                    <h2>The Retro Roast Journey</h2>
                    <p>Retro Roast began with a simple idea: to create a place where the charm of the past meets the flavors of today. 
                        We wanted to build a space that feels like a nostalgic time capsule, where every cup of coffee and every bite 
                        of pastry brings back memories of yesteryear. Inspired by the cozy coffee shops of the Seventies and Eighties, vinyl 
                        records, arcade games, and cassette tapes, Retro Roast is more than just a coffee shop—it’s a trip down memory lane.</p>

                        in every cup we brew. From our signature Cassette Cappuccino to the Polaroid Pour-Over, each of our drinks is carefully 
                        crafted to bring out the best in every flavor. Our baristas are passionate about coffee and dedicated to making your 
                        experience as rich and satisfying as possible</p>
